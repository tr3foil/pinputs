  inputs = {
    nixpkgs.url = "github:NixOS/nixpkgs/nixos-unstable";
    pinputs.url = "github:tr3foil/pinputs/main";
  };

  outputs = inputs@{ self, nixpkgs, pinputs }: {
    nixosConfigurations.myComputer = nixpkgs.lib.nixosSystem {
      system = "x86_64-linux";
      modules = [
        ./configuration.nix
        pinputs.nixosModules.default
        { pins = { inherit inputs; }; }
      ];
    };
